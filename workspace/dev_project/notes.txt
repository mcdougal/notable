- "note" : note name represented as a number (0 - 11) + rest (-1)
  i.e. used for key

- "Note" : note object with a name, octave (optional), and duration
  i.e. exists within time

- "length" : number of shortest supported durations

- Every object in the "composition.music" package exists within time and
  must be passed some length on construction
